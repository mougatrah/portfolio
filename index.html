                Hello! My name is Phelan and I am going to school for web development. My intent is to turn my 5 years
                of interest in programming into a practical skill.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've followed along with Harvard's CS50 class, learning programming fundamentals in C. 
                I downloaded Unity3D and learned the basics of C#. For mobile games I followed some of 
                a book on Java for Android apps.
            </p>
            <p>
                In preparation for UC Berkeley's web development bootcamp I went through freecodecamp's
                curriculum. I have completed 655 of 1408 coding challenges, built 8 out of 30 projects, 
                and earned 2 out of 6 certifications.
